Version 0.4.0 (beta)

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

 - ISIS version 1.6 or higher (<http://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/>)

 - XSTAR version 2.22 or higher
   ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/plasma_codes/xstar/warmabs22dev.tar.gz

   The HEASOFT package, with local models must be installed on your
   system, and then the xspec module must be built for isis.  See the
   ISIS and HEASOFT installation instructions.  Further information on
   various software components can be found at the first or second "SCHOOL ON
   MULTIWAVELENGTH ASTRONOMY" sites.  In particular this link for
   local models:

INSTRUCTIONS
============

I. Retrieve the XSTARDB ISIS package
----

 Method 1: Download tar ball from <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/analysis/xstardb/xstardb.tar>

    tar -xvf xstardb.tar

 Method 2: Clone the git repository

    git clone http://space.mit.edu/cxc/analysis/xstardb/xstardb_repo.git xstardb


II. Set environment to XSTAR installation
----

 This is the local model directory, and is the default root for the
 warmabs data and populations files:

 e.g., in .bashrc file:

    export LMODDIR=/path/to/heasoft_warmabs_<nnbit>

 e.g., in .cshrc file:

    setenv LMODDIR /path/to/heasoft_warmabs_<nnbit>

 (where "<nnbit>" refers to the build version and architecture string)

 If you have non-standard data or populations, you should also set the
 WARMABS_DATA and WARMABS_POP environment variables.

 The default initialization is to use the current paths defined in
 your environment.  These can be overridden in the ISIS code (see
 below).



III. Point .isisrc to XSTARDB installation
----

 In your .isisrc file:

    add_to_isis_load_path("/path/to/my/xstardb");

 This is not necessary if you have installed xstardb in a place that
 is already in your isis load path.

==================================
CUSTOMIZING XSTAR LIBRARY AND POPS
==================================

 If you would like to use a custom warmabs library or pops.fits file,
 you can point to their locations within the xstardb.sl script without
 having to change your system environment or default configuration.

 To do so, invoke xstardb_setup after loading xstardb but before
 evaluating any XSTAR models:

    require("xstardb");
    xstardb_setup( ; lmoddir="/path/to/my/warmabs/installation", 
    		     warmabs_data="/path/to/my/warmabs/data",
		     warmabs_pops="/path/to/my/warmabs/pops" );

 WARNING: Once the xstar module has initialized during the first model
 evaluation, the configuration cannot be changed without exiting the
 session.
